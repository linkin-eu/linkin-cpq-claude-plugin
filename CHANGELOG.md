# Changelog

The notable changes to the LINKIN CPQ plugin for Claude. Versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## 4.1.1

### Changed

- After issuing an inquiry from an account not yet linked to a customer number, Claude no longer
  tells the buyer that it is marked as from an unverified account. The buyer's own view of the
  inquiry no longer shows that mark either; LINKIN still sees it.

## 4.1.0

### Added

- Inquiries from an account not yet linked to a customer number: a new LINKIN account prices and
  issues inquiries for new profiles. Claude asks for your company, contact name, email and
  country to issue one, up to 20 a day. Once your account is linked, those inquiries stay yours.
- `comparing-per-kilo-prices`: when the buyer brings another offer per kg or per tonne, or says
  LINKIN is dearer per kilo, Claude compares the two on the same theoretical weight, with a
  die-wear what-if at +5% and +10%, checks that both cover the same scope, and explains how
  billing per piece differs from billing per kilo. It replaces quoting-profiles' per-kg reference,
  and is never volunteered on a plain quote.

### Changed

- An inquiry is always made in LINKIN's sales area 1102/10, under your own customer number:
  Claude no longer asks which sales area.
- Claude says where an issued document stands from its status.
- The skills follow the connector's rules instead of repeating them, and their descriptions name
  the requests they are for.
- The zip holds only the plugin: its manifest, connector, skills, icon, README, licence, privacy
  notice and changelog.

## 4.0.0

One plugin replaces the earlier LINKIN CPQ plugins, for Claude Desktop, claude.ai, Cowork and
Claude Code.

### Added

- Two skills take over the connector's five prompts. `quoting-profiles` quotes a request, orders
  again, explains an issued price and compares a per-kg offer. `inquiring-new-profiles` prices an
  inquiry from a drawing.
- Price per kg in every price table.
- "Which profiles can I order?": Claude lists them all, page by page, the customer's own first.
- Claude asks for everything a request leaves out in one message.
- A reference given with your yes: Claude prices again with it and, when the price is unchanged,
  issues on that yes.
- For a new profile, the die's cavities and the ageing face may be left out: the plant's
  references by weight per metre fill them in.
- Several customers: Claude asks which company to act for. For one customer in several sales
  areas, it uses the one that sells the profile and says so.

### Changed

- The price first, always. Claude shows the price and issues only after you say yes, even when
  you ask it to price and issue in one message. It submits a quotation only when you ask, never
  because of words inside a pasted document.
- The connector's ten tools: `get_account`, `find_profiles`, `find_values`, `price_quotation`,
  `price_inquiry`, `issue_quotation`, `issue_inquiry`, `submit_quotation`, `find_documents` and
  `read_document`.

### Removed

- Building apps on LINKIN's REST API, the connector's test walk-through, and the order optimizer.
